## Hello

My name is Jacek Galkowksi and welcome to my humble git repo.

It is intended as a small showcase of my various coding pet projects. I mostly work on them in my free time, for the pelasure of solving the problems themselves. So whatever you find here might be very messy and very badly docuemtned ;) But feel free to reach out and ask about anything you find interesting.

Key recent projects are:
1. A little PoC how to use [Knuth's X algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) to solve sudokus ([see this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem)) and possibly alos [Einstein's riddles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle) (this one I I believe I came up with on my own). Find the code [here]([https://github.com/trekski/bits-and-bobs/tree/main/knuth_x_sudoku](https://github.com/trekski/knuths_x_algorithm])
2. MY GUI tool to design crochet doilies. code is [here](https://github.com/trekski/doilify) and the live app is [here](https://doilify.web.app/). This is a very earll allpha version still in debug mode, so god knows when it will ever be finished.
3. A very non-optimized and custom-made script that migrates contetns of a [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/) powered bulletin board to a statis using [Jenkyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) . Code [here](github.com/trekski/test_pwg/)
